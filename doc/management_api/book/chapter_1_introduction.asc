== Introduction

The Adapt Management API provides RESTful resources for developers to read and
modify data stored within the Adapt Content Management System for use in third
party applications.

== Features

This section describe how the API is organized and how it all works together.
The following sections provide a high level overview of the features in the API.


=== REST

The API is built as a RESTful API. Data is exposed in the form of URIs that
represent resources and can be fetched with HTTP clients.

IMPORTANT: For the time being, the API does not support HTTP headers like
If-Modified-Since and similar. Data retrieval is limited to what is provided by
the APIs as-is.

=== Authentication

To access the APIs, the client must authenticate against the Adapt instance
that you want to manage. No data is available to unauthenticated clients.

For the time being, only authentication through the standard login process is
supported. In the future, it will also support features like API keys and
authentication tokens.

=== Formats and Protocols

Data returned in the response messages are provided in JSON format. Please refer
to the examples provided with each API section for additional information.

=== Error Handling

This outlines the errors returned by the APIs as a result of the internal error
handling.

IMPORTANT: This section is not complete.

*HTTP Response Code 404*
A request was made concerning a resource that could not be found.

*HTTP Response Code 422*
A request was made to create or modify data, but the data did not pass the
validation test.

*HTTP Response Code 500*
An internal error was raised within the API. This should generally not happen.
